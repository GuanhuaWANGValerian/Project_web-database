# Project Web&Database
This repersitory presents the project completed during the Christmas holiday of the 2nd year of my master's degree in NLP 
at INALCO (Institut National des Langues et Civilisations Orinetales) in Paris. It's about creating a suite of **dynamic websites 
with a database.**    
Websites interacted with the database by using PHP language to send MySQL requests and post results to on HTML.  

Subject of the project is `Chinese Airports`. It's aimed at providing organised information of airports in mainland China to help:
- Travel lovers for decision making:  
  1. By discovering a region/province and its airport information using "search by regions" fonction
  2. By adding comments on a certain airport, including their feelings, opinions or practical information
  3. By consulting comments on a certain airport, left by other users  
- Humain or sociological science researchers for their demographic or society research:
  1. By referencing information of a certain region/province of China (mainland)
  2. By consulting and comparing, by different criteria, users' comments to make remarks on inter-regional development
